//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
const movies = ['Indiana Jones', 'Fight Club', 'Poniyin Selvan'];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let bestMovieEver = movies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let length = movies.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
const lastMovie = movies[  length - 1];
